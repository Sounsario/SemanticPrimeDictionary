# SemanticPrimeDictionary
The Semantic Prime Dictionary is a non-circular dictionary with all non-primitive words defined by primitive words and/or other words that were defined with primitives.

A python program will be provided in the future to allow querying the definitions of words and their hierarchical state relative to the semantic primes.
